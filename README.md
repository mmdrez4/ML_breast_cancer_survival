# ML_breast_cancer_survival

The objective of this project is to utilize advanced machine learning techniques to analyze and predict survival outcomes in breast cancer patients. By integrating clinical data, such as patient age, stage of cancer, and treatment history, with detailed gene expression profiles, we aim to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast survival rates. This interdisciplinary approach combines medical insights with computational algorithms to enhance understanding and improve prognostic accuracy in breast cancer care.
